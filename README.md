# CoreArbiter

The Core Arbiter is the core allocation component of Arachne. It allows an application to request and obtain managed cores in the form of threads running exclusively on a core.
To start the CoreArbiter's server process, it is sufficient to build and run it as root.

```
make
sudo bin/coreArbiterServer
```
